# MCTHNet

The Pytorch implementation of *"A modality-collaborative convolution and transformer hybrid network for unpaired multi-modal medical image segmentation with limited annotations"*.




## Requirements

Experiments were performed on an Ubuntu 18.04 workstation with one 24G NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs , CUDA 11.1, and install the virtual environment (python3.8) by:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Implementation

Our proposed methods and training details  could be found as following:
